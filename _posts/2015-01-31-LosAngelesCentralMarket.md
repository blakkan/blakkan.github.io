The [Los Angeles Grand Central Market](http://www.grandcentralmarket.com) dates from 1917.  It's at 317 South Broadway, but goes through the entire block and also opens onto the middle of the 300 block of Hill street.  An interesting old-time market, now with various trendy food stalls.  A good place for lunch, but give yourself an extra hour or so to see some of the immediately surrounding sights.  Across Hill street you can see Los Angeles' one-block-long cable car system "Angel's Flight."   (Not currently operating)  Across Broadway you'll find the [Bradbary Building](https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/bradbury-building), famous for its age (opened in 1893) and the many films and motion pictures filmed there.  Also on that block you'll find Ross Cutlery, home to a fine selection of cutting tools of every kind - cooking, shaving, seamanship, jungle exploration - and a big selection of harmonicas thrown in as a bonus.  


Hill street entrance.  Note the "Knit-Bombed" interior columns.

Coffee bar just inside.  Nice selection, some unusual items.  Try the *Business and Pleasure*, a half serving of espresso served with a Latte and a mildly hop-infused fizzy-tea chaser.

In addition to the restaurants, it's still a working market:
