Quick trip to the Bay Area, stopping at Buellton on the way out, and Highway 101's Gaviota Rest area on the way back.  

Saw this interesting fellow when we stopped in Buellton.   About 12 inches long.

As we started our journey home from the Bay Area-  What's that in the rearview mirror? Gaining on us.  Slowly, menacingly, inexorably...   It's the Oscar Meyer Weinermobile!  

The horror...  The horror...

On the way back, stopped (as usual) at the Gaviota rest area on Highway 101.  Took a moment to notice the views.

Here's a closeup of some madrone bark seen at the rest area.
