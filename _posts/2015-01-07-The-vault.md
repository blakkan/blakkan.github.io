A few pictures from the archives.

Drying persimmons from the backyard tree.   First, slice into 3/16th inch slices:

Then dry, and store in airtight glass jars.   Pretty good;  when dried, they are sweeter than fresh.

Here was some fun.  We thought we had a slow running drain.   We actually had a collapsed lateral line.  Trenches under the plywood are over seven feet deep.
