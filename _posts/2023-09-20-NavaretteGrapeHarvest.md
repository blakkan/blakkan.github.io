Only 576 kilometers to go... This sign is at a famous vinyard entering
Navrette.  Note the new fleece jacket around my waist.  Weather has been
getting colder.  Note also the footwear replacing the hiking
shoes in which I've been blistering.  Recently the trail has been clay
instead of gravel and *much* nicer to walk on.  (Perhaps the clay
soil is the reason this is a grape-growing region.)

The grape harvest is underway in Navrette.

There is a tradition here for pilgrims (and perhaps other trekkers) to fashion
small crosses from scrap lumber to attach to
fences along the trail.

I believe I have at least partial resolution to the issue with the bag
transfer service, and hope to have my larger backpack back soon.  Until then I'm
managing with my smaller day bag.
