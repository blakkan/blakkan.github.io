Years ago, this was a fun place to go to play in the sand on on the beach.  But in recent years, it's been largely converted to Federal Wilderness status, so it's a three hour walk to the beach.   There is a small woodland road which has some overlooks of the dunes, but there isn't easy access to the beach.

And Lake Michigan to the West.

On the way home, we drove through Kalkaska, and photographed the trout statue in the town square.
