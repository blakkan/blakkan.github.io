On our way to Ojai for a day trip.  We paced this Amtrak train alongside highway 101.

This is the iconic tower on the main street through town.  The downtown area is largely a botique/tourism area.

The main downtown block has a long covered sidwalk.  
And who's that- sitting on the shaded bench - next to the dog...
