On the Sunday following the Rose Parade, the floats are available for viewing.  This forms a sort of "reverse parade," in which the floats are stationary, and the people walk by.  

The giant Disney 3-chassis float received a lot of attention this year:

But the Honda float really excelled, with intricate depictions of Californa native (or once-native...) wildlife on the rear of the float, and Japanese wildlife on the front:

More floats:

This is a view you don't get while watching the parade.  Note the drver's viewport in the center of the image.

The driver's seat.

This float - a polynesian-style ocean-going canoe - represented various Taiwanese interests.  The design was perhaps a subtle reminder that Taiwan has a separate cultural history from the mainland.  And thus should continue to be thought of as a separate country.

The National Park Service was there in force.  Their float depicted Mt. Rushmore, memorializing four US presidents while implicitly commemorating the triumph of European settlers over the indigenous people of North America.

Here a Park Service officer administers the "Jr. Ranger Oath" to a group of children, inducting them into national service.  To the left, a drill instructor prepares to escort the new recruits to buses which will take them to *Camp Grizzly* to begin 12 weeks of basic training.

This float was was dedicated to women's progress in the new society.  Here a young girl salutes while reciting the student's morning pledge:  *"O, Beloved Leader, Your wisdom enlightens the world..."* etc., etc.

And here, also offering the party salute, we see the fruit of her studies: Today, any girl can grow up to be a real estate agent.
