Saw this on the street not far from my house.  Someone unfortunately lost
their RV (and, I believe, their home.)  I checked the local media, didn't find
a reference to any injuries.

A cautionary sight; We'd been thinking of getting a small RV/Van.  Of all the considerations,
I hadn't put fire safety that high.  Higher on my list now.
