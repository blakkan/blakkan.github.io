Lots of photos today.

Passing through tiny towns, largely de-populated (e.g. Curia, population 60.)
Few businesses except for those directly related to Camino travelers.

This was my first day walking that I wasn't greeted by a friendly (or hungery) cat.  May be these
villages are so empty there's probably not enough food to support a cat
population.

Here are some typical tapas.  When I finish walking for the day (In the late afternoon) I get two
or three of these depending on how hungry I am.  And then again between
seven and nine pm.

During the 1400s-1500s people would put a family crest on their buildings.  This
one may be depicting the papal triple-crown, with angels holding the keys.
It resembles the flag of Vatican City and Papal coats of arms.

There are a lot of iron pilgrim sculptures along the way.

This is the super small (Population 60) village of Curia.

And more photos of small-town Spain.

My feet are generally improving but occaisionally one blister will
give trouble.  The various bandages or moleskins are not too effective
once blisters form (may work better at preventing "hot spots" from turning
into blisters.)  What does work are sock liners.  Plus, when road conditions
are good, I switch to flip-flops for the last few miles each day to let 
the feet dry out.

The sign of approach to my end-of-day lodging.

Recycling bin.  Unexpected graffiti.  Don't know if this is random cruel
mischief or a sign of something worse.

Emptiness of the small town.

This water is perhaps a gift to pilgrims on their way.  It was a common
site in the small towns. (Possibly offered in the spirit of Matthew 10:42)
