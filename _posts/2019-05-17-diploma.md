Another decade, another degree.  This was OK; lots of interdisciplinary stuff.  Talking
about the Cuban Missile Crisis, which color schemes to use on graphs.  Not totally
focused on software.

Final group project was a little pushcart that used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) on
a Raspberry Pi to distinguish between weeds and crop plants, and spray herbicide
(colored water, actually) on the weeds.

We had a final event at the football stadium restaurant; here are some pictures of the campus 
at sundown

The university is justifiably proud of the number of its faculty and researchers who
have been awarded Nobel Prizes.  They top-up the Nobel committee's award with an
even more handsome honor:  A parking permit for the central campus Nobel-Laureate
parking lot.
