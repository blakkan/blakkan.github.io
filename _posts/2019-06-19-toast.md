There has been a lot of finger-wagging this year about $6.00 cinnamon toast
in San Francisco, and also about this weird meme/stereotype of Millennials
destroying their financial future with Avocado toast.  The warnings were so
dire that I was, of course, drawn to it.

While in Berkeley for unrelated reasons, I saw the dread avo toast on the menu,
and fell victim to the allure... the siren song...

Another day I made a special trip to San Francisco to have the expensive cinnamon
toast.   Not cheap, but it was pretty good toast.

And, really, there ought to be a video record:
