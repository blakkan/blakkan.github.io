Stayed a second day in Belorado, as I couldn't get lodging resevations at
my next stop (all booked up.)  Tommorow planning to make it to the outskirts
of Burgos, which is the 1/3 point.  The whole trail divides into approximate
thirds, the first being Pamplona to Burgos, Burgos to Le&oacute;n, and Le&oacute;n to Santiago de
Compostela (With the middle third actually being a little shorter.)  Here's a map
(zoom for detail)

These hearts are everywhere as a container for recyled plastic.  Also
my favorite classic BMW model (red car in background.)

Sporty and serious cyclists.  Yellow bag is my food from the market.
Good, and cheaper than restaurants.  Note that most goods are in
glass jars, rather than cans.  Easier to open, but of course subject
to breakage.

Knitbombing!

Infrastructure... Not clear if vandalized or just fell apart.
