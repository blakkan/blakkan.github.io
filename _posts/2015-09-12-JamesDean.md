Driving to LA by a different route this weekend, came upon the location where actor James Dean met his death in 1955.  

Several highway signs have been set up around the intersection.

From the Wikipedia description, the accident took place about where the 55 mph sign is standing.

On one of the signs, small mementos (or offerings?) had been attached.

Rest in peace, Mr. Dean.
