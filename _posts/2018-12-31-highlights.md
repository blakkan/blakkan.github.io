March 3rd, went out to the California central valley to take some pictures for use in a
class project.  Took various images of the sky and the land.  I recall that the distant
rain - visible, but not falling on the nearby land - seemed somehow unobtainably out of
reach.  Had me thinking of Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath."

From July, stopping at the Jersey Shore during a work-trip to the east coast.

We devoted a portion of the front yard to growing heirloom pumpkins on a homemade trellis.
This was the wonder of the neighborhood, and passers-by on the sidewalk stopped to look
at it all Summer and Autumn.

In other pumpkin-related business, we were stuck in traffic on Halloween behind this
while on our way to a halloween party.

And this is me, overheating in the costume my family members compelled me to wear.
Not really a happy bunny at the time.

Visited Santa Cruze closer to Thanksgiving.  Saw a choice older Chrysler with the classic
"Suicide Doors."
