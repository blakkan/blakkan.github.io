Last motocyle races of the season in Ventura.  The view on the way into the grandstand.

There were multiple classes of motocyles, including flat-track and speedway bikes.

There's a lot of activity to be seen in the pit area.  (It's possible to buy a pit pass, but a lot of this can be seen through the fence).  Between the heat races and the main event, the racers and mechanics are repairing and tuning their machines.

The side cars look pretty tame when coming onto the track...

...but when the race is on, there's nothing tame about it.

The second rider in sidecar racing is called "The Monkey."

A few pictures from the end of the evening; including this accidental repoduction of the state flag of South Carolina.
