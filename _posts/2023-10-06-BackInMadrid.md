Back in Madrid for a few days prior to my flight back to the US.

Here's a traditional Madrid breakfast.  Good toasted bread with a fresh puree of
tomato, salt, and olive oil.  Very simple, but delicious and
refreshing (and a nice break from the potato frittata breakfasts on the camino.)

My hotel lobby and room.  This was about &euro;150 per night, probably
four times the cost of lodging of this category on the trail.  Didn't
seem like a good value, and I probably wouldn't stay at this place again.
However, it was conviently located to the main downtown area of Madrid.
But it's showing some wear and tear for this price (note worn-through
toilet seat.)

I suppose it was charging a premium for the location (but I was only
intersted in basic accomodations.)

Video of view from my window.  Although this doesn't show it, this is an all-night
entertainment & party area.  People are in bars and clubs until 5am.  And
there's all kinds of activity going on in the streets.
