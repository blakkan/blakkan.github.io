Driving from San Francisco Bay Area to Southern California on I-5.  

Starting in San Francisco Bay Area.  Oranges still good on the tree, with next season's bloom beginning.

Kumquats ripe, in time for lunar new year.

Someone isn't impressed with the citrus.

Just off I-5 the Almonds were in bloom.

The bee boxes (for polination) had been distributed to the orchards.

And just the other side of an electric fence, this year's lambs:
