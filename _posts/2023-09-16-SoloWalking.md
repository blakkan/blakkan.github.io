Best day yet;  Walk was through open, empty country.  No fellow walkers this day.  

Figured out how to tighten clamps on the walking sticks to prevent compression.

Still finding backpack (28 Liter) larger than I needed,
really only need a student-style book backpack.

Note about the famous "Wine Spigot."  It only runs during certain hours.
