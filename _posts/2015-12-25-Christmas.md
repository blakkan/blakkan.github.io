Low-key Christmas this year; stayed home, no visits to relatives.

Some tree ornaments:

These were made from Stephanie's wedding boquet flowers:

The small, hard-to-find pickle ornament (only about one inch long).  Apparently a Geman tradition, chldren search the tree for the pickle.  Our germanic culture consultant from Stuttgart had never heard of such a thing.  But our informant from Frankfurt (am Main) indicated that this was indeed a legitimate tradition, and not just something the Christmas ornament industry had invented.
