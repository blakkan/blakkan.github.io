In Mexico City for a wedding, toured a large market with a friend.  Lots of different bulk spices or sweet flavoring
syrups and powders.

There was a walking tour; had several street tacos from
sidewalk stands, as well as in the market.  (Yes, I did
get sick, but I think it was more likely the water.)

Wedding was in an older part of town.  Many parks.
