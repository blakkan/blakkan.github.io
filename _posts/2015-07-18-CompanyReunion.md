Reunion of co-workers from an early-2000's startup.  We merged this company into a larger firm just at the tail end of the tech boom (or, more to the point, just as the tech bust started).  

The event took place at the Palo Alto home of the former Chairman of the Board.

The backyard garden was perfectly suited for the event.  Just the right size for the group, and the plantings (and mature shade trees) gave welcome relief from the sun.  This Bronze was one of the focal points of the garden.

Stephanie spent some time showing one of the children how to play ball.

We'll never see *that* ball again...
