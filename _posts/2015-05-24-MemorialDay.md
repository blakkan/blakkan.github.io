Down to Deer Creek Beach on the Malibu coast, setting up for photos of Stephanie's art project.  Of course we took along the dog, to play fetch and generally interfere with the photography.  

Looking for that ball in the surf...

And he's got it.

And ready to throw the ball again.

Exposure of this one is totally wrong.  But I still like it.

Later in the weekend, driving through Grimes Canyon (California Highway 23, between the cities of Moorpark and Filmore) scouting photo sites, found these cactus in flower beside the road.

The canyon winds through a deposit of sand, showing various deposition strata (This is a view of about 16 vertical feet.)

This material is very soft; people carve various temporary engravings into it.   Some simple grafitti, some elaborate murals.   (Hard to get photos of many of them; there aren't a lot of safe places to pull over on this section of road. This photo isn't representative of the more creative ones.) Folk art or vandalism?  Hard to say... But each winter's rains erase most of them.
