On the trail from Lagro&ntilde;a to Navarrete.  Open spaces, many
vinyards

I continue to enjoy the meals.  For a fairly modest price, the
restaurants serve excellent, simple meals.  The vegetables are fresh,
and the ingredients seem minimally processed.  My gut health has been
better on this trip than at home.
