Feet better, looking forward to getting back on the trail.

Bought a light hooded jacket, as weather has turned cool.

There is a local wine festival underway, so people are wearing
these bandanas around their necks.  Mostly maroon, but have seen
a few different colors.  The person in the brown shirt is wearing
one.

This was in a shop, seems related to the wine festival, with the
grapes and wine bota bag.  Note the bandana around the maniquin's waist
is the same as worn by the man in the previous photo.

This is the beverage of choice on the trail.  Hydration with electrolytes.
And tastes good.  Somewhat comparable to Gatoraid&trade; in the US.

Also, the man-bag is very common, not just with trekkers.  Note the man
in black with the color co-ordinated bag.
