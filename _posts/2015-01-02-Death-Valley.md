Trip to Death Valley over New Year's weekend, 2015.  First stop: The Ash Medows wildlife area.  

Ash medows is east of Death Valley.  Although a dry, alkali flat, there is water below the surface.  Hot springs feed small streams, which are the only home of small desert pupfish.

Here is the famous "Devil's Hole," only home of the highly endangered Devil's Hole Pupfish.  The instruments visible at one end of the pool are for remote monitoring of the water level and other conditions in the pool.  This photo is taken from a public-access viewing bridge over the hole, which is perhaps fourty feet above the water level.

There are more Mesquite trees than Ash trees visible from the boardwalk, and most of them carry a heavy crop of mistletoe.  (Looking quite dead or dormant this time of year).

A closer view of mistletoe.   Notice the white berries; these are spread from tree to tree by birds.

Then into Death Valley proper.  A spectacular view can be had from the "Dante's View" lookout.  It's a steep drive, but your reward is a vista of the whole valley.

There are lots of things to see in the valley- old mining operations, salt flats, sand dunes, etc.  But Death Valley is really about the rocks.   Lots and lots of rocks.  If you like rocks, this is your place.  (But take note:  January and February are among the better months to visit.  It has reached 134F in the summertime.)
