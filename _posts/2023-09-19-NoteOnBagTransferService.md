After carrying an over-large pack for my first week, I'm buying a smaller bag.

There are several services which will transport packs or other luggage from
stop to stop along the
trail, I'm using this one https://www.elcaminoconcorreos.com/en/rucksack-transfer
which is part of the Spanish postal service.  They charge by total distance
covered (that is, the sum of all your days' travel) plus the total number of
stops.  They also offer discounts for certain predefined routes and overnight
stopping points.

I chose to have complete freedom to choose where to stop each night, so the total
cost was &euro;130.  But the discounted pre-planned routes are less.

How it works:  Each evening before 8:00pm you send email or go on their website
and tell them where you are that night, and where you will be the end of the next day.
Next morning have your bag packed at the front desk by the pickup time of 8:00am.
Then walk to your next stop.  Your bag will be at your next stop by 2:30pm.

That's how it's supposed to work...  But when I signed up, I didn't copy down
the booking number on the webpage before the page was gone.  And I didn't
get an email message with the booking number (which you need to order each day's
pickup.)  My credit card was charged, but I didn't have anything to show for it.
[Note: it later turned out that the pending charge on my credit card was
never actually paid. This may have been the source of the problem.  Nothing
wrong with my card - it wasn't suspended- the payment just didn't go through.]

I called the bag transfer service's number and couldn't get an
english-speaking representative.  Eventually got an email address, and started
emailing back and forth with them (in English.)

Not fully resolved, will report updates in a later post.
