Visit to Lake Charlevoix.  First stop, the pub for the obligatory pub food.

Not to be outdone, I had the epic serving of fried perch:

While in Charlevoix, saw this tied up.  Spoke briefly to the owners.  It's a sin to covet,
but this was a fine looking trawler.

More in line with the budget, there's a small fish/duck pond in town, where for $0.25 you
can toss the fish a treat.  Probably want to wash your hands afterwards, before dinner.

Lots of these at the dog park; had been a wet autumn

But a delightful sunset after running Ollie.

Back on the lake, Ollie's first canoe ride.  He seemed to take to it, being part retriever.

Back at the house, found this odd and creepy thing on the garage roof.  A deer skull.
Left there by a racoon?  Porcupine?  Neighbor with an odd sense of humor (or menace...)

On a happier note, given all the fallen trees, this is my new best friend:

Back into town (Petosky, this time.)  Salmon were running in the river (this is right downtown,)
so fishermen were out.

A stop at a new favorite near Petosky:  Bubbling Spring park.  In a half mile walk you can see
several of the spings, the outflows merginging to form a stream.

Finally, an evening by the fire ring.
