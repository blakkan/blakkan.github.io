Driving south on 101, near Refugio Beach, I noticed a helicopter making an unusual delivery.  I suspect it was connected with the cleanup operations from the recent oil spill near Refugio State Beach.

Yes, that's a Porta-Potty being delivered.  At first glance, seeing the stripe on the helicopter, I thought it was the Coast Guard.  On closer inspection, it isn't actually the Coast Guard color scheme.  

As the helicopter banked, the outhouse swung wide... I wondered what *that* ride would be like.

On reflection, probably the only sensation would be that of an increase in weight. Just a feeling of being pressed down onto the seat, little different from a carnival ride.  In a windowless flying outhouse, a passenger's only frame of reference is the swinging outhouse itself.  

So if you're ever in a Porta-Potty, and you hear the roar of a helicopter overhead, and you suddenly feel much, much, heavier- don't open the door.  You're the victim of an elaborate prank.
