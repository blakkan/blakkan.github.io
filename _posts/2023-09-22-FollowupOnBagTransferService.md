After I finally got my large backpack back from the Correos bag transfer service,
I'm changing over to Jacotrans.

Jacotrans doesn't require credit card payment, or setting up an advance itinerary
or getting on the phone or website the night before to arrange pickup.  Just put
the appropriate number of euros in an envelope attached to your bag (the hotels generally
have the envelopes) and leave it with the front desk before 8:00am.  Write the destination
on the envelope.   You must have a luggage tag on your bag with name and contact information,
but you don't need a booking number, since you pay for the bag transfer in cash each day.

(But of course, you do need to have euros in small denominations each day.)
