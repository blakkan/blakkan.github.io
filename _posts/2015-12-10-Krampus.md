A "Krampus Run" was held in Los Angeles this year, with participants from Austia.  The holiday tradition is that St. Nicolas is accompanied by a troupe of demons.  Good little boys and girls are rewarded by the saint.  But bad little Austrian boys and girls don't just get a lump of coal.  They're actually carried away by a demon, to an unknown - but no doubt horrible - fate.  

This took place in downtown LA, with one city block was cordoned off for the event.  About three hundred spectators turned out for this; a mix of families with young children, the downtown hipster gentry, and a few stragglers from the suburbs.

Kampus is known for using whips and switches in his work.  Note the basket carried on his back.   This is for transporting the misbehaving children he's taken into custody.

Although fearsome, Krampus is quite willing to pose with spectators:

St. Nicolas arrives on a steam-powered tricycle cart, driven by one of the demons.  Here he exhorts the crowd:

And greets the spectators with a friendly smile:

A voice in the crowd was heard to say:  "Boy, when these Austrians go bad, they go all the way."  And that voice was mine.  

Others were apparently less impressed;  This must be a native Angeleno... texting in the presence of a horned demon.
