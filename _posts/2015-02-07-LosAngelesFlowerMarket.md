The Los Angeles flower market is on the edge of the fashion district in downtown LA.   One dollar gets you admission to two warehouse like structures featuring various vendor stalls.  It's a wholesale market, but sells retail as well.   


Into the first building

It being late winter, they had flowering quince branches (and other tree flowers):

But they were fake!

Farewell to the flower market; on to Santee Alley
