In Filmore California, at the end of Fish Hatchery Road, one is unsurprised to find a fish hatchery.  Water flows through four cement tanks, each about 1000 feet long, six feet wide, and perhaps 3 feet deep, arranged in two separate pairs.  A single lane of pavement runs along each side of the tanks, with a third lane separating the two pairs.  

The facility is enclosed by fences and netting to prevent predation by birds of prey and other wildlife.  However, there are gaps large enough to admit a few blackbirds.

Fish are raised here by the State of California for release into various local reserviors (and various other release sites).

There are barriers every few hundred feet along the length of the tanks.  These separate the fish of different ages as they are grown to release size.

The fish are fed oily, unpleasant-smelling pellets, stored in these hoppers.

Visitors may purchase pellets from converted gumball machines (bring dimes- no change is available).  

As you approach the tank, the fish will rise to the surface in expectation of a meal.

There is a real feeding frenzy when pellets hit the water.

There are a few other sights to see.  There's a variety of equipment to be seen.

Just outside the fenced area the outflow has created a small oasis populated by waterfowl.  An eager welcoming committe for any escaped fish, or any other small creatures living on the nutriant flow from the hatchery.

A few oasis residents have learned to beg through the fence for fish-food pellets.
