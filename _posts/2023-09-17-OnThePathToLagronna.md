Exhausted by day's end; feels like low blood sugar.  Need to rest
and drink electrolytes.

This is how a horse is raised (upper right in photo).  So sad.
Small village of Sansol.

Three girls from the states running a lunch truck on the trail.  They were
a lifesaver.  I bought two waters and an orange juice and the owner
pulled up to close things down and he gave me a snickers and cheese sandwich
Por grata.  They were very nice people; a Christian co-op.  They also have a 
cafe in Viana.

I was greeted by this little guy (so adorable) and many other animals. It
was a nice thing to see after walking 14 miles.
