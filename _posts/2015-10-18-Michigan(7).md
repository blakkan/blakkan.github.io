We had some time in Detroit before our flight left, so we went down to see the "Heidelberg Project."   It's a few blocks of houses and vacant lots repurposed by an arts collective.

On the way across Detroit to reach it, we passed this sign in an empty lot.  This is apparently serious (it wasn't near the arts collective).  I'm not sure it's legal, however.   I don't think Raccoons taken with a hunting or trapping license can be sold for meat (unless the laws have changed in recent years).
