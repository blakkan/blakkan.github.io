Visiting a friend's sailboat July 21st and 23rd in Santa Cruz, CA.  

My genial host, Cap'n Mike, takes the helm.  (Actually, we stayed in port, and went to the Thursday evening music-on-the-beach event).

And the charming first officer, Cap'n Mike's lovely bride Jan.

His slip is right at the entrance to the harbor, so there's always something passsing by.  Sailboats, paddle-boarders, sea otters.

The band.

And part of the crowd.  The turn out this evening was several hundred.
