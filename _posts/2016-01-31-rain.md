A side trip to the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds (The "Fairplex") for the Reptile Super Show.   

![Convention Hall](/images/2016-01-10_reptiles/show_view.png){: .dropshadow }  

Every reptile you might want (and can legally own...) was on offer.   Monitor lizards (about three feet from nose to tail):

Tortoises:  This one said to be eight years old.

These hatchlings were less than three inches long:

Baby snakes.

And geckos.

Various other lizards.   Note the tongue on the lizard being handled.

Luch at the fairgrounds was every bit as appealing as one would expect.

And on the way out of the hall, another attraction.  An outdoor "Garden scale" railroad exhibit.  Perhaps three quarters of an acre in size.

And the tram awaits, to carry us all in comfort and safety back to our automobiles
