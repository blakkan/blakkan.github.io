Unexpected early snow arrived the day we were to return to Detroit.

We drove into town to buy boots (we had arrived in Michigan with only flip-flops and driving moccasins).

Fortunately the hardware store had boots to replace the flip-flops...

And the farmer's market goes on, heedless of the snow.

Stephanie, clearly delighted by the winter wonderland, admires a snowman someone has built.

With proper footwear available, a splendid time was had by all.
