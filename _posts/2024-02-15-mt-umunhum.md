Visible throughout much of the southern Santa Clara Valley (also known as
"Silicon Valley",) an old radar station sits on a mountaintop.  It was part
of a cold-war era air defence system.  The radar equipment is long gone, and
a parking lot and small visitor area has been built.  (There isn't access to
the inside of the 8-story building.)
