Port Hueneme's Missle Park is just off Highway-1 about a mile North of the Los Posas Road intersection in Ventura County.  The displays were being refurbished during this visit, so a few of the big cruise missles (Regulus and Regulus-II) were hidden behind scaffolding and shade cloth.  

The Navy does missle testing and development at Port Hueneme.   When missles become obsolete and otherwise useless, some are gelded of their warheads and used as target drones for testing the next generation.  (Some days at the office I feel a sense of empathy with those old missles...)

Here's an F-4 Phantom.   My Uncle flew these in the Navy:

And an F-14 Tomcat.  Tom Cruise flew these in a movie:

An interesting bit of history-  After World War II, the US made copies of the German V-1 "Buzz Bomb," designated as the "Loon."

This unusual-looking thing is a torpedo fitted with drop-away wings and a rocket motor.

There are various air-to-air and air-to ground missles on display, as well as a Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missle.  (The Polaris looks like it's in the process of being repainted- lots of spots sanded off, apparently in preparation for priming and re-painting.)
