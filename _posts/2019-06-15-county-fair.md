About what one would expect.  Farm animals, family fun, and delicious, healthful food.

Some belted cattle

And goats

Rabbits and newborn bunnies

And a snapping turtle, for some reason.  Glad it was behind glass.

Family fun.  First was the piglet race.

But here's something to give one pause.  A mechanical bull ride, with warning signs
stating "Each rider must sign an assumption of risk."  A smiling child atop the ride.
A parent with a camera captures the moment.
But note the ticket taker's chair.

Some type of rodeo event was in the offing.  Bull riding apparently.  I passed
on watching this.

Detail of the gladiators, about to enter the ring.  Very Hemmingwayesque.

And the food!  There was a new thing this year- Nachos built on a substrate of
tater-tots intead of the usual corn chips.  It's sweeping the country, apparently.  And
an absolute gut-bomb.  They call them "Tachos" (Tater-tot Nachos.)

And there was other stuff on offer as well.
