Still issues with the phone charging and internet.  Will need to find
a store carrying this brand of SIM card (it's actually an eSIM.)

I stayed at a narrow converted three-story flat.  It 
had the Japanese style "Coffin Pods."  It was awful.  I was
supposed to stay for two nights to get adjusted, but instead hit the trail the
next day.  There were too many people crowded close (and coughing.)  Also,
the pods were on the 3rd floor and the WC was on the first and I had a top 
bunk.  I started walking at 7:30am the next morning.
