A few random images I liked.

This was a patchouli seed newly germinated.

Oysters on ice.  I liked the mix of the organic patterns of the
shells, contrasted with the highly artificial mesh bag.

Recently in O'hare Airport in Chicago.  It was very crowded- this photo doesn't
give the full impression.  It seems America is traveling again.  (At least
through Chicago.)

This had been spray painted on the back of a sign in a local park, outside
the offical off-leash fenced area.  The crude, dripping letters gave a slightly "Slasher-Movie" look to it.  I hope that wasn't the intent.

Note the "O" of "DOG" appears to be a crude dog face, with eyes and ears.
