Spending the day in Santiago de Compostela.  A few pictures of the cathedral.

Here was the final stamp log I showed to qualify for the certificate of
completion.  The one for the inital part of the walk was lost (I still have
a photograph of it.)  But this has the stamps from Sarria to Santiago, and Sarria is
within the minimum qualifying distance (100km.)

Ringing of the cathedral bell.  Not much to see in this video, but
it captured the sound.

Here's one of the famous incense burners they swing across the cathedral on
special days.  (Or on any day when the donations cross a certain limit.)
I didn't have the opportunity to see it in operation.

Various local delicacies on offer around town.

Interesting fixtures in the ceiling of a brewpub (or was it a wine bar?)
Not sure of the exact function, but perhaps it is for racking wine
(or beer) off the dead yeast.  This is just a guess, based on the
access door on the front, and the large diameter pipe coming out
the bottom (possibly for washing out the leftover yeast.)

I've been fortunate to not have lost anything to theft so far, but eventually my luck ran
out.  Someone (perhaps hotel cleaners) stole my hoodie and I had to buy a new one.

Dsappointing, but no great hardship.  Here's the replacement.

More sights on my last day in Santiago before taking the train back to Madrid.

The manicure and color

And the superior European man-bag.  Need to get one of these for a gift.

A few more scenes, including trash collection. Highly visible in
their distinctive uniforms, they're a constant presence in the
downtown areas.  It seems there's a big effort to keep the city
centers clean.  And they were clean.  Some places in the US could
perhaps take a lesson from Spain.

There was an outdoor market this day, with the seasonal chestnuts.  And, as ever,
hikers with walking sticks.
