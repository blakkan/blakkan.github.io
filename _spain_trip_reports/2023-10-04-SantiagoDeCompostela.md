The hardware store is selling items for the chestnut season.  That pan with
holes in the bottom is the traditional thing
in which to roast chestnuts.  And the rake is the traditional thing with which
to rake them up.

Unusually in this part of the world, I received a full FOUR ice cubes
with my drink.  Apparently, they could tell I was a foreigner and humored me.

I've given up the hiking shoes and flip-flops in favor of sandals.  And that
simple string bag is what I carried for the second half of the trail, after I
started using the backpack transfer services between stops.

A trail video of passers-by, a few greetings in Spanish, then in English from people I'd
previously met on the trail.  Including their comments about
the sandals. My reply to them at 0:48
about "Raw doggin' it" refers to my not wearing socks.

And a final video of a stream which sustained previous pilgrims and
travelers from time beyond memory.
