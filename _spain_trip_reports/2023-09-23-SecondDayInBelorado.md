Stayed a second day in Belorado, as I couldn't get lodging resevations at
my next stop (all booked up.)  This is unfortunate, as about 15 young kids have
arrived at my lodging along with their mothers, and these kids are LOUD.  Also,
the beds here are very short, and my feet are hanging off.

Tommorow I expect to make it to the outskirts
of Burgos, which is the 1/3 point.  Will be staying there at the "Boomerang Cottage"
bed and breakfast.  (Will see if it's Australia themed.)

The trail divides into approximate
thirds, the first being Pamplona to Burgos, then Burgos to Le&oacute;n, and finally
Le&oacute;n to Santiago de
Compostela (With the middle third actually being a little shorter.)  Here's a map
of my progress (zoom for detail.)

These hearts are everywhere as a container for recyled plastic.  Also
my favorite classic BMW model (red car in background.)

Sporty and serious cyclists.  Yellow bag is my food from the market.
Good, and cheaper than restaurants.  Note that most goods are in
glass jars, rather than cans.  Easier to open, but of course subject
to breakage.

Knitbombing!

Infrastructure... Not clear if vandalized or just fell apart.
